# HDD-Spec-1.1-Official
HDD — Human Digital DNA: The Immutable, Future-Proof Standard. ULTRA FINAL MASTER SPECIFICATION 1.1  
The Universal Protocol for Human Activity Data  
One Standard to Rule Them All • Zero Updates • Zero Servers • Eternal*
What is HDD?
HDD is a simple, immutable, and eternal standard** for representing any human digital activity in a unified format. It is designed to work everywhere — from mobile apps and AI systems to neural interfaces and quantum computing — **without ever needing updates**.
```JavaScript
// The Core Triplet — Simple, Eternal, Powerful
"click::1735682400000::1"
"purchase::1735682400000::150::{'currency':'USD'}::1.1"
Why HDD?
Solves Data Chaos
Every app, platform, or AI uses different data formats.
HDD unifies them into one global language.
Built for the Future
Supports AR, VR, neural data, quantum streams — via the optional context field.
100% backward compatibility guaranteed.
Zero Maintenance
No servers, no SaaS, no dependencies.
Core library < 50KB. Works fully offline.
Get Started in 60 Seconds
Install the Core Library
bash
npm install hdd-core
Start Using HDD
javascript
import HDD from 'hdd-core';
// Basic event
const event = HDD.encode('login', 1);
// Advanced event with context
const advancedEvent = HDD.encode('purchase', 150, {
  currency: 'USD',
  items: ['laptop', 'mouse'],
  user_tier: 'premium'
});
// Parse any HDD string
const parsed = HDD.decode(advancedEvent);
The HDD Format
Core Structure
text
[activity]::[timestamp]::[value]::[context?]::[version?]
Part	Description	Example
activity	Type of action	click, purchase, custom_event
timestamp	Unix timestamp in ms	1735682400000
value	Numeric value or complex object	1, {'revenue': 150}
context	Optional metadata (JSON)	{'device': 'mobile', 'os': 'ios'}
version	Optional schema version	1.1
Key Features
Future-Proof by Design
Add any future tech (neural data, quantum states) via context
Core format never changes — guaranteed
Multi-Impact Value Engine
javascript
// Simple value
"click::1735682400000::1"
